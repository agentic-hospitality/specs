faqs:
  - question: "What's changing about how people book travel?"
    answer: "People are starting to ask AI assistants to plan trips instead of searching websites. 'Find me a quiet hotel near the conference center that allows dogs', and the agent handles it. This changes how venues need to be discovered."

  - question: "Will my property still be found?"
    answer: "Not automatically. AI agents can't read your website the way Google does. They need structured data: what rooms you have, what makes you special, whether you're available. These specs define that structure so agents can find and understand you."

  - question: "What about my existing booking system?"
    answer: "You keep it. These specs define how AI agents connect to your property management system to check real-time availability and make bookings. It's a new channel, not a replacement for what you have."

  - question: "How do agents know they can trust a venue?"
    answer: "The same way you do: through who vouches for them. Tourism boards, hotel groups, and certification bodies can endorse venues in ways agents can verify. Real recommendations, not just star ratings."

  - question: "Is this just for hotels?"
    answer: "No. The specs work for anything bookable: restaurants, spas, tours, experiences, event spaces. If it has availability and can be reserved, it fits."

  - question: "What about OTAs and existing distribution?"
    answer: "This isn't about replacing your existing channels. It's about being ready for a new one. When travelers start booking through AI agents, you want to be discoverable."

  - question: "Do I need to be technical?"
    answer: "Venues don't need to read specs. Your technology provider or property management system will handle the implementation. The documentation is there so they know what to build."

  - question: "Who's building this?"
    answer: "It's an open standard. The specs are on GitHub. Anyone can read them, propose changes, or help improve the documentation. We're building this together."
