# For Curators

If you verify, endorse, or vouch for hospitality venues, you can become a Curator.

---

::note
Curators are the trust layer. Without you, agents can't tell good venues from bad ones, real from fake, or "family-friendly" from "adults-only."
::

## Who can be a Curator?

::card-group{cols=2}
  ::card{title="Cottage companies" icon="ph:house-line"}
  Property portfolios who verify and manage holiday rentals. You already know which properties are real and well-maintained.
  ::

  ::card{title="Hotel groups" icon="ph:buildings"}
  Chains and collections who vouch for their member properties. Brand standards become verifiable claims.
  ::

  ::card{title="Tech platforms" icon="ph:devices"}
  Booking platforms, channel managers, PMS providers. You have data about real operational venues.
  ::

  ::card{title="Membership orgs" icon="ph:users"}
  Tourism associations, quality schemes, accessibility certifiers. Your standards become agent-readable.
  ::

  ::card{title="Review platforms" icon="ph:star"}
  Editorial guides, specialist publications. Expert assessment as structured endorsement.
  ::

  ::card{title="DMOs" icon="ph:map-trifold"}
  Destination marketing organisations. See [For DMOs](/audiences/dmos) for specific guidance.

## What Curators do

::card-group{cols=3}
  ::card{title="Verify" icon="ph:check-circle"}
  Confirm venues exist and operate. Your attestation is evidence agents can trust.
  ::

  ::card{title="Endorse" icon="ph:seal-check"}
  Make specific claims: "pet-friendly", "accessible", "sustainable". Qualities agents can filter by.
  ::

  ::card{title="Maintain" icon="ph:arrows-clockwise"}
  Keep endorsements current. Revoke when standards slip. Your reputation depends on accuracy.

## The value exchange

| Stakeholder | What they get |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Agents** | Trusted signals they can act on |
| **Venues** | Visibility through legitimate endorsement |
| **Guests** | Recommendations backed by authority |
| **You** | Influence over how your portfolio is represented to AI |

## Types of claims

Curators make specific, verifiable claims:

| Claim type | Example | Evidence |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Verification** | "This venue is a legitimate business" | Company registry, site visit |
| **Endorsement** | "This venue is suitable for families" | Your assessment criteria |
| **Certification** | "This venue meets our quality standards" | Your certification process |
| **Operational** | "This venue is currently accepting bookings" | Live booking data |

## Commitments

::warning
Curators must be transparent. This is non-negotiable.
::

- Declare any commercial relationships (portfolio ownership, referral fees)
