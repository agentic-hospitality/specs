# For Enterprise

Large organisations with internal hospitality needs.

---

::note
If you're managing travel for thousands of employees, booking meeting rooms across dozens of offices, or coordinating accommodation for events at scale — the same protocols apply.
::

## Enterprise use cases

::card-group{cols=2}
  ::card{title="Corporate travel" icon="ph:airplane"}
  Employee booking against policy. Preferred hotels, rate caps, sustainability requirements — all expressible as agent constraints.
  ::

  ::card{title="Meeting rooms" icon="ph:presentation-chart"}
  Internal room booking with the same Bookable pattern. Availability, capacity, equipment requirements.
  ::

  ::card{title="Event accommodation" icon="ph:calendar-star"}
  Block bookings for conferences, training, offsites. Coordinate across multiple venues.
  ::

  ::card{title="Supplier management" icon="ph:handshake"}
  Your approved vendor list becomes a private Curator feed. Preferred rates as structured data.
  ::
::

## Why open standards matter

::card-group{cols=2}
  ::card{title="No lock-in" icon="ph:lock-open"}
  Protocols are open. Your integrations work across vendors. Switch tools without rebuilding.
  ::

  ::card{title="Internal + external" icon="ph:arrows-out"}
  Same patterns for internal rooms and external hotels. One agent, multiple venue types.
  ::

  ::card{title="Policy as code" icon="ph:code"}
  Travel policy becomes agent instructions. Compliance is automatic, not manual checking.
  ::

  ::card{title="Audit trail" icon="ph:list-checks"}
  Structured data means structured reporting. Who booked what, why, at what rate.
  ::
::

## Integration patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Internal Curator** | Your approved vendor list as a private Curator feed |
| **Policy engine** | Agent constraints from HR/finance policy |
| **Private venues** | Internal meeting rooms using Bookable protocol |
| **Aggregated reporting** | Folio data into expense systems |

## What you'd build

::steps
  ::step{title="Private Curator"}
  Your approved hotels, negotiated rates, sustainability ratings. A Curator feed only your agents can see.
  ::

  ::step{title="Policy layer"}
  Transform travel policy into agent constraints: max rates, preferred chains, carbon limits.
  ::

  ::step{title="Internal venues"}
  Meeting rooms, parking spaces, desk bookings — all as Bookable entities with real-time availability.
  ::

  ::step{title="Reporting integration"}
  Folio data flowing into expense management, carbon accounting, procurement analytics.
  ::
::

## Getting started

::steps
  ::step{title="Identify use cases"}
  Which internal processes involve booking? Where are the manual bottlenecks?
  ::

  ::step{title="Map to protocols"}
  Which protocols apply? Bookable for availability, Venue for descriptions, Folio for costs.
  ::

  ::step{title="Pilot scope"}
  Start small. One venue type, one policy constraint, one integration.
