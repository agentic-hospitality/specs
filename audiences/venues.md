# For Venues

What hospitality businesses need to know about being AI-bookable.

---

::note
Guests are starting to use AI agents to book travel. "Find me a dog-friendly hotel in Devon" → Agent searches, compares, books. If your venue isn't represented in a way agents understand, you won't be found.
::

## What you need to do

::steps
  ::step{title="Publish structured data"}
  Not just a website — structured information agents can parse. What you are, what you offer, your policies. This is what [Venue](/building-blocks/venue) defines.
  ::

  ::step{title="Connect your systems"}
  Agents need live availability—not cached data from yesterday. Direct integration with your PMS means real-time inventory and instant confirmations. See [Connect](/building-blocks/connect).
  ::

  ::step{title="Get endorsed"}
  Agents trust Curators. Being endorsed by your DMO or a respected guide means higher visibility and more confident recommendations. See [Curator](/building-blocks/curator).

## What agents will know about you

::card-group{cols=3}
  ::card{title="Identity" icon="ph:identification-card"}
  What you are (hotel, restaurant, bar), where you are, how to contact you.
  ::

  ::card{title="Offer" icon="ph:door"}
  Rooms, tables, facilities. What's bookable and at what terms.
  ::

  ::card{title="Policies" icon="ph:clipboard-text"}
  Cancellation, pets, accessibility, check-in times. The rules of staying.
  ::

  ::card{title="Evidence" icon="ph:check-circle"}
  Third-party verifications, ratings, certifications. Proof, not claims.
  ::

  ::card{title="Vibe" icon="ph:sparkle"}
  The feel of your place. "Cosy country pub" vs "Sleek city bar."
  ::

  ::card{title="Answers" icon="ph:chat-circle-text"}
  Pre-composed responses to common questions agents can quote.
  ::
::

## What you don't need to do

::card-group{cols=3}
  ::card{title="Build AI" icon="ph:robot"}
  You don't need your own AI. Agents handle the intelligence.
  ::

  ::card{title="New systems" icon="ph:gear"}
  The specs work with existing infrastructure — PMS, channel manager, booking engine.
  ::

  ::card{title="Abandon OTAs" icon="ph:x-circle"}
  This is a new channel, not a replacement. Keep what works.
  ::
::

## Common questions

::accordion{title="Will this replace OTAs?"}
AI agents are a new channel, not necessarily a replacement. They may book through OTAs or directly, depending on what's available. Think of it as another distribution path.
::

::accordion{title="Do I need to pay for endorsement?"}
DMOs may charge membership fees that include identity services (like issuing your DID) — that's normal association membership. What Curators *can't* do is sell endorsements themselves. They endorse based on quality, not payment. If someone's offering "premium placement" in exchange for fees, that's pay-to-play advertising, not curation.
::

::accordion{title="What if an agent gets it wrong?"}
Agents work from the data published. If your data is accurate and structured, agents will represent you accurately. Bad data in = bad recommendations out.
::

::accordion{title="Why is direct connection preferable?"}
Two reasons. First, agents work in real-time—when a guest asks "do you have a room tonight?", the agent needs an answer now, not from a cache. Direct integration means live data and instant confirmations.

Second, the guest journey doesn't end at booking. With direct connection through [Stay](/building-blocks/stay), the agent can help throughout—room preferences before arrival, charges during the stay, modifications if plans change. The guest's agent becomes a continuous companion, not just a booking tool.
::

## Next steps

::steps
  ::step{title="Audit your data"}
  Review what structured data you currently publish. Is it accurate? Complete? Machine-readable?
  ::

  ::step{title="Check your PMS"}
  Does your property management system support direct API access? Ask your vendor about agent integration—certified systems handle Connect automatically.
  ::

  ::step{title="Contact your DMO"}
  Ask about Curator endorsement. They may already be preparing.
  ::

  ::step{title="Get in touch"}
  Reach out to discuss implementation support.
