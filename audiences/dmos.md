# Curator for DMOs

If you're a destination marketing organisation, regional tourism board, or hospitality authority, you're a natural Curator.

---

::note
AI agents are going to book travel. The question is whether they'll book *your* destination's venues or someone else's.
::

## You already have what agents need

::card-group{cols=2}
  ::card{title="Local knowledge" icon="ph:map-pin"}
  You know your territory's venues — who operates what, where, and how well.
  ::

  ::card{title="Relationships" icon="ph:handshake"}
  You work with operators continuously. You spot changes before anyone else.
  ::

  ::card{title="Quality standards" icon="ph:seal-check"}
  You maintain standards and hold venues accountable.
  ::

  ::card{title="Destination story" icon="ph:book-open"}
  You understand what makes your place special and who it's for.
  ::
::

Curator lets you turn that expertise into something AI agents can use.

## What you'd do as a Curator

::card-group{cols=2}
  ::card{title="Verify venues" icon="ph:check-circle"}
  Confirm venues are legitimate, operational, and as described. Your attestation is evidence agents can trust.
  ::

  ::card{title="Endorse qualities" icon="ph:star"}
  "This venue is family-friendly." "This restaurant serves local produce." "This hotel is wheelchair accessible."
  ::

  ::card{title="Tell stories" icon="ph:notebook"}
  Curate narratives. "The best coastal walks with pub lunches." "Hidden gems in the old town."
  ::

  ::card{title="Maintain standards" icon="ph:shield-check"}
  If quality drops, update your endorsement. Your reputation depends on accuracy.
  ::
::

## The value exchange

| Stakeholder | What they get |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Agents** | Trusted local knowledge they couldn't get otherwise |
| **Venues** | Visibility through an authority agents trust |
| **You** | Influence over how your destination is represented to AI |

## Commitments

::warning
Curators must be transparent. This is non-negotiable.
